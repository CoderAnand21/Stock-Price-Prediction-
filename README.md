# Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning



This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting stock prices. The goal is to develop models that can forecast the future prices of stocks based on historical data and other relevant factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used includes historical stock prices along with additional features such as trading volume, market sentiment indicators, and possibly macroeconomic factors. The data is typically obtained from financial databases or APIs.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and engineer relevant features for model training.
  
- **Model Selection:** Implement and compare different machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LSTM (for time series data), and others.
  
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess prediction accuracy.
  
- **Deployment:** Deploy the best-performing model for making predictions on new data or integrating into trading algorithms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for exploring notebooks)
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`
- Access to financial data sources or APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explore and visualize the historical stock price data to understand trends, patterns, and correlations with other features.
   
2. **Model Training:** Train machine learning models using scripts provided in the repository, experimenting with different algorithms and parameters.
   
3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics and visualizations provided in the notebooks or scripts.
   
4. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict future stock prices based on new data.
